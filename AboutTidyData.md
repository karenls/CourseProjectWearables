### Note about Tidy Data and My Choice to use the Long Form

##### Definition of Tidy Data

* Each variable in the data set is placed in its own column
* Each observation is placed in its own row
* Each value is placed in its own cell

##### About the Long Form

Hadley Wickham, in his article "Tidy Data", states, "To tidy [the data], we need to melt, or stack it. In other words, we need to turn columns into rowsâ€¦ this is often described as making wide datasets long or tall." He goes on to explain that melting converts the columns containing the values into two variables: a column that contains "repeated column headings and a new variable called *value* that contains the data values from the previously separate columns."  (page 6, *Journal of Statistical Software Volume VV, Issue II*. http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)

In "[An Introduction to reshape2](http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html)" blogger Sean C. Anderson additionally states:

> It turns out that you need wide-format data for some types of data analysis and long-format data for others. *In reality, you need long-format data much more commonly than wide-format data* (emphasis added). For example, ggplot2 requires long-format data (technically tidy data), plyr requires long-format data, and most modelling functions (such as `lm()`, `glm()`, and `gam()`) require long-format data. But people often find it easier to record their data in wide format.
